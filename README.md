# School-Projects

Utilising Python, NumPy, and Pandas in creating simple games and tasks with AI-based commands. I have created a tic-tac-toe game that obtains inputs from users and calculates the next best move in order to obtain the best possible outcome. I have also created a path analyzer that finds the shortest route from the entrance to the exit.
